# Normally, SMEM prohibits and stores coexisting is recognized as a bad command
# Using this source, keep prohibits on the smem.prohibit-list instead of smem.command
# They will be sent to smem.command automatically except when trying to store
# If attaching a store command while the prohibit-list is populated, attach to smem.command.pre-store instead
# This will invoke an operator to do the swapping out of the prohibits and the swapping in of your store
# You will then need to clean up the translated smem.command.store as usual
